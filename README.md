**Welcome to JiraAutomation**
Jira Automation is used to automatically fetching contents and downloading it, saving into organised folder.
For that I used Jira rest api to fetch current project and suthenticate with username and jira-api token.
fetch currently active board of project with specific board-name. ex.IGN INFO-Delivery
fetch currently active sprint with sprint-name. ex Dec24 Game Dev
fetch issues of this sprint and fetch specific issue with issue type. ex Game story type
from each issue check attachment present or not.
check attachment with specific word in it .
download that attachment and save with name as headline of that issue .
save it in particular folder in your local pc.
Use it for further purpose.
